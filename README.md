# CriminalIntentChapter17

Continued Android Practice From the BigNerdRanch Guide to Android Programming, this project is for practice only

General Android program written using "The Big Nerd Ranch Guide to Android Programming" by Bryan Sills, et. al. (aka a bunch of brilliant dudes).

This is by no means a guide, or even showcase of my abilities. This is purely an exercise to keep my Android skills sharp and up-to-date.

(Note: I'm pushing new code in segments of chapters instead of pushing to a new branch as an easier way to get back to what I want to refresh on in each chapter.
